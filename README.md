Hello, I'm AinTea and I'm a neophyte developer.
Average <b>Bash</b> enjoyer and trying to become some kind of cyber-expert.<br>
I'm learning Python and C++ in order to have as much tools at my belt as Mr. Sin- I mean as any plumber has.
Also I like doing shitty stuff that half-works with anything I see cuz I probably have some mental disorder that makes me have 7 IQ at my maximum.

One day some wise person said: <b>Illegal ? Illegal only if police there. If police not there, everything legal.</b>
