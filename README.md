Average Bash enjoyer and trying to become some kind of shitpost-expert.<br>
I'm learning Python and Rust in order to have as many tools at my belt as Johnny Sin- I mean as any plumber would have.<br>
Also I like doing shitty stuff that half-works with anything I see probably because I have 7 IQ at my maximum potential.

One day some wise person said: "<b>Illegal ? Illegal only when police there. If police not there, everything legal.</b>"
